<p>
 I am an electrical engineer at <a href="https://www.airport.kr/co/en/index.do">Incheon International Airport Corporation</a>. 
 I have been working at Incheon Airport Corporation as an electrical engineer since 2015. 
 I have sought to advance the airportâ€™s electrical signal data collection by managing the SCADA system. 
 After I recognized the potential impact AI can have on electrical engineering and the airport overall, 
 I enrolled in Georgia Tech's <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS</a> program and successfully completed my master's in computer science in 2020 while working full time.

<p>
My research interests lie in the field of Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
I have worked on Batch Reinforcement Learning, Text Summarization, and Adapters, resulting in workshop publications at EMNLP and ACL.

<p>
I'm deeply passionate about machine learning and want to utilize AI to improve my work as well as the quality of life for all and positively impact society.
