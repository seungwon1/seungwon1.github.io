<p>
Machine Learning Engineer with a background in aviation systems engineering.
</p>

<p>
I started my career managing aviation electrical systems and SMGCS infrastructure at Incheon International Airport. Working in safety-critical environments sparked my interest in building intelligent systems capable of operating under real-world constraints.
</p>

<p>
I later earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, conducting research in Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. My work contributed to publications at EMNLP and ACL workshops.
</p>

<p>
Today, I design predictive models and operational optimization systems for airport operations, combining engineering rigor with machine learning to solve complex, large-scale problems.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly interested in applying AI to infrastructure, transportation, and high-reliability systems.
