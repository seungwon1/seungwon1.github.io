<p>
I began my career as an electrical engineer at <a href="https://www.airport.kr/co/en/index.do"> Incheon Airport Corporation</a>, 
focusing on the development and enhancement of critical aviation electrical systems, including SCADA, SMGCS, and VDGS.
Beyond managing these systems, I sought to advance the airportâ€™s electrical signal data collection processes. 
After I recognized the potential impact AI can have on electrical engineering and the airport operations, 
I enrolled in Georgia Tech's <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS</a> program and successfully completed my master's in computer science in 2020 while working full time.

My research interests lie in the field of Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
I have worked on Batch Reinforcement Learning, Text Summarization, and Adapters, resulting in workshop publications at EMNLP and ACL.

I'm deeply passionate about machine learning and want to utilize AI to improve my work as well as the quality of life for all and positively impact society.
